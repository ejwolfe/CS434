# Examples from 4notes15

## Example 1
MovieStar (name,address,gender,birthdate)

How do we express FD: name -> address
- (MovieStar (MS1) $\bowtie_{MS1.name = MS2.name AND MS1.address <> MS2.address}$ MovieStar (MS2)) = $\emptyset$

## Example 2
Student(ID, name, address, GPA, SAT)
Campus(location, enrollment, rank)
Apply(ID, location, date, major, decision)

An application must be tied to an existing student.
- $\pi_{ID}$ (Apply) - $\pi_{ID}$ (Student) = $\emptyset$
- $\pi_{ID}$ (Apply) $\subseteq$ $\pi_{ID}$ (Student)

A campus must have non-zero enrollment.
- $\sigma_{enrollment = 0}$ (Campus) = $\emptyset$
