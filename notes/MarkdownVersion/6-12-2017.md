2. Intersection
    - R $\cap$ S
3. Set Difference
    - R - S

# Relational Operators

2. Select
    - $\sigma_{predicate}$(R)
3. Cartesian Product
    - R X S
4. Natural Join
    - R $\bowtie$ S
5. Theta Join
    - R $\bowtie_{predicate}$ S

# Examples 4notes13 part 2

Movie (Title,Year,length,filmType,studioName,producerC#)
StarsIn (MovieTitle,MovieYear,StarName)
MovieStar(Name,address,gender,birthdate)
MovieExec(name,address,Cert#,netWorth)
Studio (Name,address,presC#)

1. Find all movies made by disney
    - $\sigma_{studioname='Disney'}$(Movies)
2. Find all movies made by disney or MCM
    - $\sigma_{studioname='Disney'or studioname='MCM'}$(Movies)
3. Find all movie execs that are also movie stars
    - $\pi_{name}$(MovieStar) $\cap$ $\pi_{name}$(MovieExec)
    - or
    - MovieStar (MS) $\bowtie$ MovieExec (ME)
      - $MS.name = ME.name$
4. Find the names of all execs who work for a studio of which they were employed as a star
    - MovieExec $\bowtie_{CertNum = PresNum}$ Studio
    - Movie (M) $\bowtie_{Title=MovieTitle AND Year = MovieYear}$ StarsIN (SI)
    - MovieExec $\bowtie_{CertNum = PresNum}$ Studio $\bowtie_{ME.name = Starname AND Studio.name = Studioname}$ Movie (M) $\bowtie_{Title=MovieTitle AND Year = MovieYear}$ StarsIN (SI)
5. Find all movies that have exactly 1 star
    - ($\pi_{MT, MY}$(StarsIn)) - ($\pi_{S1.MT,S1.MY}$(StarsIn (S1) $\bowtie_{S1.title = S2.title AND S1.year = S2.year AND S1.starname < S2.starname}$ StarsIn (S2)))
6. Find all movies that have at least 2 stars
7. Find all movies with exactly 2 stars

    - Option 1
      - $\pi_{starname}$($\sigma_{length > 100}$(Movies $\bowtie_{Title = MovieTitle AND Year = MovieYear}$ StarsIn))
    - Option 2
      1. Movies $\bowtie_{Title = MovieTitle AND Year = MovieYear}$ StarsIn
      2. $\sigma_{length > 100}$(1)
      3. $\pi_{starname}$(2)
    - Option 3

      3. $\bowtie_{Title = MovieTitle AND Year = MovieYear}$
          -  Movies
          -  StarsIn
2. Find the address of the studio who produced the Star Wars movie made in 1977
    - $\pi_{Address}$
    - $\bowtie_{studioname = name}$
      - $\sigma_{t = st AND y = zy}$
        - movie
